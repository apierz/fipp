* Fipp

*Fipp* is a Feed Interface Poorly written in Python3 with a curses UI. It is inspired by my love of Mutt, the terminal email client.

Fipp is designed to work with online RSS feed tracking services, rather than manage subscriptions itself. This is so your changes propagate across all your devices.

Fipp is currently in alpha so it is quite buggy, any bug reports would be greatly appreciated.
