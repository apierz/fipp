[An
SSC
reader
working
at
an
Oxford
library
stumbled
across
a
previously
undiscovered
manuscript
of
G.K.
Chesterton’s,
expressing
his
thoughts
on
AI,
x-risk,
and
superintelligence.
She
was
kind
enough
to
send
me
a
copy,
which
I
have
faithfully
transcribed]

The
most
outlandish
thing
about
science
fiction
is
that
it
believes
itself
outlandish.
Ezekiel
saw
wheels
of
spinning
flame
and
reported
it
quite
soberly;
our
modern
prophets
collapse
in
rapture
at
the
wheels
of
a
motorcar.
Mr.
H.
G.
Wells
is
considered
shocking
for
writing
of
inventors
who
travel
thousands
of
years
into
the
future,
but
the
meanest
church
building
in
England
has
done
the
same.
And
when
Jules
Verne
set
out
to
‘journey
to
the
center
of
the
earth’
and
‘from
the
earth
to
the
moon’,
he
seemed
but
a
pale
reflection
of
Dante,
who
took
both
voyages
in
succession
before
piercing
the
Empyrean
itself.
1
Yet
if
the
authors
disappoint,
it
is
the
reviewers
who
dumbfound.
For
no
sooner
does
a
writer
fancy
himself
a
Poe
or
a
Dunsany
for
dreaming
of
a
better
sewing
machine,
but
there
comes
a
critic
to
call
him
overly
fanciful,
to
accuse
him
of
venturing
outside
science
into
madness.
It
is
not
enough
to
lower
one’s
sights
from
Paradise
to
a
motorcar;
one
must
avoid
making
the
motorcar
too
bright
or
fast,
lest
it
retain
a
hint
of
Paradise.
1
The
followers
of
Mr.
Samuel
Butler
speak
of
thinking-machines
that
grow
4
[grander and grander](https://philpapers.org/rec/GAROTI-3)
5
until
–
quite
against
the
wishes
of
their
engineers
–
they
become
as
tyrannical
angels,
firmly
supplanting
the
poor
human
race.
This
theory
is
neither
exciting
nor
original;
there
have
been
tyrannical
angels
since
the
days
of
Noah,
and
our
tools
have
been
rebelling
against
us
since
the
first
peasant
stepped
on
a
rake.
Nor
have
I
any
doubt
that
what
Butler
says
will
come
to
pass.
If
every
generation
needs
its
tyrant-angels,
then
ours
has
been
so
inoculated
against
the
original
that
if
Lucifer
and
all
his
hosts
were
to
descend
upon
Smithfield
Market
to
demand
that
the
English
people
bend
the
knee,
we
should
politely
ignore
them,
being
far
too
modern
to
have
time
for
such
things.
Butler’s
thinking-machines
are
the
only
tyrant-angels
we
will
accept;
fate,
ever
accommodating,
will
surely
give
them
to
us.
1
Yet
no
sooner
does
Mr.
Butler
publish
his
speculations
then
a
veritable
army
of
hard-headed
critics
step
forth
to
say
he
has
gone
too
far.
Mr.
Maciej
Ceglowski,
the
Polish
bookmark
magnate,
calls
Butler’s
theory
4
[“the idea that eats smart people”](http://idlewords.com/talks/superintelligence.htm)
ople”](http://idlewords.com/talks/superintelligence.htm)
5
(though
he
does
not
tell
us
whether
he
considers
himself
digested
or
merely
has
a
dim
view
of
his
own
intellect).
He
says
that
“there
is
something
unpleasant
about
AI
alarmism
as
a
cultural
phenomenon
that
should
make
us
hesitate
to
take
it
seriously.”
1
When
Jeremiah
prophecied
the
fall
of
Israel,
his
fellow
Hebrews
no
doubt
considered
his
alarmism
an
unpleasant
cultural
phenomenon.
And
St.
Paul
was
not
driven
from
shore
to
shore
because
his
message
was
pleasant
to
the
bookmark
magnates
of
his
day.
Fortified
by
such
examples,
we
may
wonder
if
this
is
a
reason
to
take
people
more
seriously
rather
than
less.
So
let
us
look
more
closely
at
the
contents
of
Mr.
Ceglowski’s
dismissal.
1
He
writes
that
there
are
two
perspectives
to
be
taken
on
any
great
matter,
the
inside
or
the
outside
view.
The
inside
view
is
when
we
think
about
it
directly,
taking
it
on
its
own
terms.
And
the
outside
view
is
when
we
treat
it
as
part
of
a
phenomenon,
asking
what
it
resembles
and
whether
things
like
it
have
been
true
in
the
past.
And,
he
states,
Butler’s
all-powerful
thinking
machines
resemble
nothing
so
much
as
“a
genie
from
folklore”.
1
I
have
no
objection
to
this
logic,
besides
that
it
is
not
carried
it
to
its
conclusion.
The
idea
of
thinking
machines
resembles
nothing
so
much
as
a
fairy
tale
from
the
2
Arabian
Nights
3
,
and
such
fairy
tales
inevitably
come
true.
Sinbad’s
voyages
have
been
outstripped
by
Magellan’s,
Abdullah’s
underwater
breathing
is
matched
by
Mr.
Fleuss’
SCUBA,
and
the
Wright
brothers’
Flyer
goes
higher
than
any
Indian
carpet.
That
there
are
as
yet
no
genies
seems
to
me
less
an
inevitable
law
than
a
discredit
to
the
industry
of
our
inventors.
1
There
is
a
certain
strain
of
thinker
who
insists
on
being
more
naturalist
than
Nature.
They
will
say
with
great
certainty
that
since
Thor
does
not
exist,
Mr.
Tesla
must
not
exist
either,
and
the
the
stories
of
Asclepius
disprove
Pasteur.
This
is
quite
backwards:
it
is
reasonable
to
argue
that
the
Wright
Brothers
will
never
fly
because
Da
Vinci
couldn’t;
it
is
madness
to
say
they
will
never
fly
because
Daedalus
2
could
3
.
As
well
demand
that
we
must
deny
Queen
Victoria
lest
we
accept
Queen
Mab,
or
doubt
Jack
London
lest
we
admit
Jack
Frost.
Nature
has
never
been
especially
interested
in
looking
naturalistic,
and
it
ignores
these
people
entirely
and
does
exactly
what
it
wants.
1
Now,
scarce
has
one
posited
the
possibility
of
a
genie,
before
the
question
must
be
asked
whether
it
is
good
or
evil,
a
pious
genie
or
an
unrighteous
djinn.
Our
interlocutor
says
that
it
shall
be
good
–
or
at
least
not
monomaniacal
in
its
wickedness.
For,
he
tells
us,
“complex
minds
are
likely
to
have
complex
motivations;
that
may
be
part
of
what
it
even
means
to
be
intelligent”.
A
dullard
may
limit
his
focus
to
paper
clips,
but
the
mind
of
a
genius
should
have
to
plumb
the
width
and
breadth
of
Heaven
before
satiating
itself.
1
But
I
myself
am
a
dullard,
and
I
find
paper
clips
strangely
uninteresting.
And
the
dullest
man
in
a
country
town
can
milk
a
cow,
pray
a
rosary,
sing
a
tune,
and
court
a
girl
all
in
the
same
morning.
Ask
him
what
is
good
in
life,
and
he
will
talk
you
ear
off:
sporting,
going
for
a
walk
in
the
woods,
having
a
prosperous
harvest,
playing
with
a
newborn
kitten.
It
is
only
the
genius
who
limits
himself
to
a
single
mania.
Alexander
spent
his
life
conquering,
and
if
he
had
lived
to
a
hundred
twenty,
he
would
have
been
conquering
still.
Samuel
Johnson
would
not
stop
composing
verse
even
on
his
deathbed.
Even
a
village
idiot
can
fall
in
love;
Newton
never
did.
That
greatest
of
scientists
was
married
only
to
his
work,
first
the
calculus
and
later
the
Mint.
And
if
one
prodigy
can
spend
his
span
smithing
guineas,
who
is
to
say
that
another
might
not
smith
paperclips
with
equal
fervor?
1
Perhaps
sensing
that
his
arguments
are
weak,
Ceglowski
moves
from
the
difficult
task
of
critiquing
Butler’s
tyrant-angels
to
the
much
more
amenable
one
of
critiquing
those
who
believe
in
them.
He
says
that
they
are
megalomanical
sociopaths
who
use
their
belief
in
thinking
machines
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
the
real
work
of
improving
the
world.
1
He
says
–
presumably
as
a
parable,
whose
point
I
have
entirely
missed
–
that
he
lives
in
a
valley
of
silicon.
I
picture
it
as
being
surrounded
by
great
peaks
of
glass.
And
in
that
valley,
there
are
many
fantastically
wealthy
lords.
Each
lord,
upon
looking
through
the
glass
peaks
and
seeing
the
world
outside
with
all
its
misery,
decides
humans
are
less
interesting
than
machines,
and
fritters
his
fortune
upon
spreading
Butlerist
doctrine.
He
is
somewhat
unclear
on
why
the
lords
in
the
parable
do
this,
save
that
they
are
a
“predominantly
male
gang
of
kids,
mostly
white,
who
are…more
comfortable
talking
to
computers
than
to
human
beings”,
who
inevitably
decide
Butlerism
is
“more
important
than…malaria”
and
so
leave
the
poor
to
die
of
disease.
1
Yet
Lord
Gates,
an
avowed
Butlerite,
4
[has donated two billion pounds](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Malaria)
.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Malaria)
5
to
fighting
malaria
and
developed
a
rather
effective
vaccine.
Mr.
Karnofsky,
another
Butlerite,
founded
a
philanthropic
organization
that
4
[moved sixty million pounds](http://www.givewell.org/about/impact)
5
to
the
same
cause.
Even
the
lowly
among
the
Butlerites
have
been
inspired
to
at
least
small
acts
of
generosity.
A
certain
Butlerite
doctor
of
my
acquaintance
(whom
I
recently
had
to
rebuke
for
his
habit
of
forging
pamphlets
in
my
name)
donated
seventy-five
hundred
pounds
to
a
charity
fighting
malaria
just
last
year.
If
Mr.
Ceglowski
has
done
the
same,
I
shall
eat
my
hat.
The
proverb
says
that
people
in
glass
houses
should
not
throw
stones;
perhaps
the
same
is
true
of
glass
valleys.
1
I
have
met
an
inordinate
number
of
atheists
who
criticize
the
Church
for
devoting
itself
to
the
invisible
and
the
eternal,
instead
of
to
the
practical
and
hard-headed
work
of
helping
the
poor
on
Earth.
They
list
all
of
the
great
signs
of
Church
wealth
–
the
grand
cathedrals,
the
priestly
vestments
–
and
ask
whether
all
of
that
might
not
better
be
spent
on
poorhouses,
or
dormitories
for
the
homeless.
In
vain
do
I
remind
them
that
the
only
place
in
London
where
a
poor
man
may
be
assured
of
a
meal
is
the
church
kitchens,
and
that
if
he
needs
a
bed
the
first
person
he
will
ask
is
the
parish
priest.
In
vain
do
I
mention
the
saintly
men
who
organize
Christian
hospitals
in
East
Africa.
The
atheist
accepts
all
of
it,
and
says
it
is
not
enough.
Then
I
ask
him
if
he
himself
has
ever
given
the
poor
a
shilling,
and
he
tells
me
that
is
beside
the
point.
1
Why
are
those
most
fixated
on
something
vast
and
far
away
so
often
the
only
ones
to
spare
a
thought
for
the
poor
right
beside
them?
Why
did
St.
Francis
minister
to
the
lepers,
while
the
princes
of
his
day,
seemingly
undistracted
by
the
burdens
of
faith,
nevertheless
found
themselves
otherwise
engaged?
It
is
simply
this
–
that
charity
is
the
fruit
of
humility,
and
humility
requires
something
before
which
to
humble
one’s
self.
The
thing
itself
matters
little;
the
Hindoo
who
prostrates
himself
before
elephants
is
no
less
humble
than
the
Gnostic
who
prostrates
himself
before
ultimate
truth;
perhaps
he
is
more
so.
It
is
contact
with
the
great
and
solemn
that
has
salutary
effects
on
the
mind,
and
if
to
a
jungle-dweller
an
elephant
is
greatest
of
all,
it
is
not
surprising
that
factory-dwellers
should
turn
to
thinking-machines
for
their
contact
with
the
transcendent.
1
And
it
is
that
contact
which
Mr.
Ceglowski
most
fears.
For
he
writes
that
“if
everybody
contemplates
the
infinite
instead
of
fixing
the
drains,
many
of
us
will
die
of
cholera.”
I
wonder
if
he
has
ever
treated
a
cholera
patient.
This
is
not
a
rhetorical
question;
the
same
pamphlet-forging
doctor
of
my
acquaintance
4
[traveled to Haiti to assist in fighting the cholera epidemic there](http://squid314.livejournal.com/297760.html)
traveled to Haiti to assist in fighting the cholera epidemic there](http://squid314.livejournal.com/297760.html)
traveled to Haiti to assist in fighting the cholera epidemic there](http://squid314.livejournal.com/297760.html)
d314.livejournal.com/297760.html)
5
.
It
seems
rather
odd
that
someone
who
has
never
fought
cholera,
should
be
warning
someone
who
has,
that
his
philosophy
prevents
him
from
fighting
cholera.
1
And
indeed,
this
formulation
is
exactly
backward.
If
everyone
fixes
drains
instead
of
contemplating
the
infinite,
we
shall
all
die
of
cholera,
if
we
do
not
die
of
boredom
first.
The
heathens
sacrificed
to
Apollo
to
avert
plague;
if
we
know
now
that
we
must
fix
drains
instead,
it
is
only
through
contemplating
the
infinite.
Aristotle
contemplated
the
infinite
and
founded
Natural
Philosophy;
St.
Benedict
contemplated
the
infinite
and
preserved
it.
Descartes
contemplated
the
infinite
and
derived
the
equations
of
optics;
Hooke
contemplated
infinity
and
turned
them
into
the
microscope.
And
when
all
of
these
infinities
had
been
completed
–
the
Forms
of
Plato
giving
way
to
the
orisons
of
monks,
the
cold
hard
lines
of
the
natural
philosophers
terminating
in
the
green
hills
of
England
to
raise
smokestacks
out
of
empty
fields
–
then
and
only
then
did
the
heavens
open,
a
choir
of
angels
break
into
song,
and
a
plumber
go
fix
a
drain.
1
But
he
is
not
trapped
in
finitude,
oh
no,
not
he!
What
is
a
plumber
but
one
who
plumbs
infinite
depths?
When
one
stoops
to
wade
among
the
waste
and
piss
to
ensure
the
health
of
his
fellow
men,
does
he
not
take
on
a
aspect
beyond
the
finite,
a
hint
of
another
One
who
descended
into
the
dirt
and
grime
of
the
world
so
that
mankind
might
live?
When
one
says
that
there
shall
certainly
never
be
thinking-machines,
because
they
remind
him
too
much
of
God,
let
that
man
open
his
eyes
until
he
is
reminded
of
God
by
a
plumber,
or
a
symphony,
or
a
dreary
Sunday
afternoon.
Let
him
see
God
everywhere
he
looks,
and
then
ask
himself
whether
the
world
is
truly
built
so
that
grand
things
can
never
come
to
pass.
Mr.
Butler’s
thinking-machines
will
come
to
pass
not
because
they
are
extraordinary,
but
precisely
because
they
are
ordinary,
in
a
world
where
extraordinary
things
are
the
only
constant
of
everyday
life.
