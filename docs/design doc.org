#+title: Design Document for Feed Reader Project

*  Goals

The goal of this project is to make a CLI RSS feed reader application that
works with Feed Wrangler (and eventually Feedly and others) to provide synching
across devices.

The project will be written in Python and use the Python curses library to
generate the user interface.

** Check if user has added an account
*** No account found:
**** User told no account has been found
**** User is prompted to Type in account email and password
**** Account Validation Process
***** If account is validated 
****** return to start of app cycle
****** store access_token from api server
***** If account is not validated
****** Relay error and prompt user to re-enter email/password
*** Account Exists:
**** Unread Feeds are retrieved from server
**** Key commands displayed at top of screen
**** Unread feed item titles are listed in a scrolling curses pad in cron order
**** The Most recent item is highlighted
**** By using the arrow keys the user can highlight the other items in the list
**** The user can "star" the highlighted item
**** if the user press enter:
***** The body text of the highlighted item is loaded in a new pad
***** New key commands are displayed at the top (star, etc)
***** User can press a command to go back to main feed list
***** User can press a command to go to prev/next iterm in feed list is poss.
