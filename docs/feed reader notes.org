* REST apis

Rest is noun based, instead of verb based

Resource: person
Service: GET contact info
Representation: name, address, phone (JSON, XML)

** Uniform Interface
Standard set of 
*** HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
*** URIs, 
*** HTTP responses (Status, body)

** Stateless
server contains noclient state
any session state is held on client state
client needs to understand that it wont always have a direct connection

** Cacheable

responses are cacheable
if not noted = implicit
explicit
negotiated

** Layered System
clients can't assume direct connection
maybe talking to a cache or other intermediary

** Code on Demand
